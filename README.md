# Keymaps
This repository contains keymaps for various keyboards I use. Most of the keymaps are for the [QMK firmware](https://qmk.fm/).

## Umlauts and special characters
For some reason I could not get the umlauts and the ÃŸ needed when writing in German to work on my Mac with the "U.S. International - PC" keymap.
Currently, on MacOS [EurKey](https://github.com/lbschenkel/EurKEY-Mac/) has to be installed additionally and then after a reboot it can be selected as an input source in the system preferences.
